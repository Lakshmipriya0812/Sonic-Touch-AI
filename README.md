# Sonic Touch

**Sonic Touch** is a voice-enabled, AI-powered e-commerce platform designed with accessibility at its core — especially for visually impaired users. The system runs entirely on Docker for consistent, portable development and deployment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **AI Assistant:** Rasa (Conversational AI & Voice Support)
- **Reverse Proxy:** NGINX
- **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose

## Prerequisites

> 🐳 You only need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. No local Node.js or MongoDB setup required.

## Setup & Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonic-touch.git
cd sonic-touch
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Create the following `.env` files:

#### `client/.env`

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

#### `server/.env`

```env

JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
PORT=5000
```

### 3. Start the Application

```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build
```

This will start all services:

- 🌐 Frontend → [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- ⚙️ Backend API → [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
- 🤖 Rasa Assistant → [http://localhost:5005](http://localhost:5005)
- 🔁 NGINX (optional if configured) → Handles routing

- Rasa and Rasa Actions are run in separate containers and exposed via API
- All routing can be handled through `nginx/default.conf`
